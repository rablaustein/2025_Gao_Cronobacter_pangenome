# 2025_Gao_Cronobacter_pangenome

Cronobacter sakazakii is an opportunistic foodborne pathogen associated with contamination of powdered infant formula. This study explores the pangenome of C. sakazakii to uncover genetic signatures associated with isolate origins across the global scale. Scripts and data that may be used to reproduce our analysis are provided here.
