# 2025_Gao_Cronobacter_pangenome

_Cronobacter sakazakii_ is an opportunistic foodborne pathogen associated with contamination of powdered infant formula. This study explores its pangenome to uncover genetic signatures associated with isolate origins, including sample type (food, environment, clinical) and continent (Asia, Europe, North America). Scripts and data that may be used to reproduce our analysis are provided here.
